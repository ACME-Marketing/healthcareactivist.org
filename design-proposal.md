## 2. Typography

The typography selections are made for clarity, readability, and impact, using fonts available from Google Fonts.

### Heading Font: **Montserrat**

-   **Why Montserrat?** Its geometric and sans-serif letterforms are clean, modern, and authoritative. It's excellent for headlines, conveying a strong sense of purpose and stability.
-   **Implementation:** Use for all `<h1>`, `<h2>`, and `<h3>` tags.

### Body Font: **Open Sans**

-   **Why Open Sans?** It is a highly legible and neutral sans-serif font that is optimized for both web and print. Its friendly appearance makes content accessible and easy to read, which is crucial for communicating complex information.
-   **Implementation:** Use for all paragraphs, lists, and general body text.

## 3. Design Rationale

The combination of this color palette and typography creates a cohesive and effective design language:

-   **Trust & Professionalism:** The dominant blue, combined with clean gray backgrounds and the stable Montserrat font, establishes a professional and trustworthy foundation. This is critical for an organization dealing with sensitive healthcare topics.
-   **Urgency & Action:** The strategic use of the red accent color draws the eye to key actions, such as "Sign a Petition" or "Donate," creating a sense of urgency without inducing anxiety.
-   **Clarity & Accessibility:** High-contrast text and the highly readable Open Sans body font ensure that all information is accessible to a wide audience, which is essential for a public-facing activist platform.
