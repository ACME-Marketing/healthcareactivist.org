# Patient Power: You Have Rights

As a patient, you are the most important member of your healthcare team. Understanding your rights is the first step toward becoming an empowered and effective advocate for your own health and the health of your loved ones. This page is dedicated to providing you with the information you need to navigate the complexities of the healthcare system.

## Know Your Rights

You have a fundamental right to quality care, respect, and dignity. Key patient rights include:

*   **The Right to Informed Consent:** You have the right to receive clear, understandable information about your diagnosis, treatment options, and the potential risks and benefits of each option before making a decision.
*   **The Right to Access Your Medical Records:** You are entitled to a copy of your medical records and to request corrections to any inaccuracies.
*   **The Right to Privacy:** Your health information is confidential and protected by law.
*   **The Right to a Second Opinion:** You have the right to seek a second opinion from another healthcare provider to help you make informed decisions about your care.
*   **The Right to Refuse Treatment:** You can refuse any medical treatment, even if it is recommended by your doctor.

## How to Be an Effective Advocate

Being an effective advocate for yourself or a loved one involves several key actions:

*   **Ask Questions:** Don't be afraid to ask questions until you fully understand your condition and treatment plan.
*   **Take Notes:** Keep a record of your appointments, medications, and any instructions from your healthcare providers.
*   **Bring a Friend or Family Member:** Having a trusted companion with you during appointments can provide support and help you remember important information.
*   **Speak Up:** If you have concerns about your care, speak up. You are your own best advocate.
