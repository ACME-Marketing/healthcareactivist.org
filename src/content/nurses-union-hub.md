# Nurses Union Hub

Welcome to the Nurses Union Hub, a dedicated resource for union nurses and a space for those who wish to learn more about the power of organizing in the healthcare industry. United, we have the strength to advocate for our patients, our profession, and ourselves.

## Why a Union?

A union provides nurses with a collective voice to address the critical issues we face every day:

*   **Safe Staffing Ratios:** Negotiating for and enforcing safe nurse-to-patient ratios is our top priority. It is the key to patient safety and nurse well-being.
*   **Fair Compensation and Benefits:** We fight for competitive wages, comprehensive benefits, and retirement security that reflect our skills and dedication.
*   **Workplace Safety:** From protection against violence to ensuring access to personal protective equipment (PPE), our union works to create a safer work environment.
*   **A Voice in Patient Care:** Through our union, we have a say in the policies and procedures that impact patient care, ensuring that clinical decisions are made by clinicians, not administrators.

## Resources for Union Nurses

This hub provides a wealth of resources for our members:

*   **Know Your Rights:** Access information about your contract, your rights on the job, and how to address workplace issues.
*   **Continuing Education:** Find opportunities for professional development and continuing education to stay at the forefront of our profession.
*   **Get Involved:** Learn how you can become more active in our union, from serving as a steward to participating in contract negotiations.
